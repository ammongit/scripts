# scripts
A collection of scripts and other utilities I have written for my personal usage. All files are copyrighted under the MIT license as specified in `LICENSE` unless otherwise specified. The scripts in this directory invoke other resources in this repo via `/usr/local/scripts`.

## Directory hiearchy
* `apps` - Contains scripts to start certain applications or other processes on my computer.
* `arch` - Scripts related to the archiving of files on my computer for long-term storage.
* `dat` - Contains data to be used by scripts. Private or encrypted data will not be present.
* `fun` - Scripts that don't serve any real purpose, and are just for fun.
* `local` - Scripts that are local to this particular machine, are not synchronized with git.
* `sbin` - Scripts that require root access.
* `wip` - Scripts that are not complete, do not function properly, or are experimental. Do not expect anything in here to work.
* `wm` - Scripts used by bindings (such as media keys) or by my window manager directly. See my dotfiles repo for more information.
